<h1>Cultural Comparison (Part 3: Compare)</h1>
<p>Today we're going to compare how different website design aesthetics change around the world. Our goal is to replicate the results from the paper <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.tb00312.x/abstract">Cultural Similarities and Differences in the Design of University Websites</a>, by Ewa Callahan. </p>
<p>
  The abstract reads:<br />
  This study examines cultural differences and similarities in design of university websites using Hofstede's model of cultural dimensions. Graphical elements on a sample of university home pages from Malaysia, Austria, USA, Ecuador, Japan, Sweden, Greece and Denmark are compared using content analysis methods. The home pages were analyzed on the basis of two criteria: organization and graphical design. Element frequency scores were correlated with Hofstede's indexes and interpreted on the basis of the existing literature. The results suggest that similarities and differences in web site design can be brought out through Hofstede's cultural model. Computed correlations between Hofstede's scores and frequency counts of interface elements were weaker than anticipated, but in most cases occurred in the hypothesized direction.

<h2>Compare</h2>
<p>Discuss with a neighbor who had a different country: In what ways are the designs similar and different? <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRMJwceKO1VYqnj9A22sFAneexcwlGNsOFf7sJPjC47iv48w/viewform?usp=sf_link">Submit your individual responses.</a></p>
