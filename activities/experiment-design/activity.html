<h1>Activity: Ordering Effects</h1>

We wish to conduct an experiment to answer the following question:
<b>Do people type dictionary words faster than they do gibberish?</b><br>

<h3>1. Find a partner</h3>
<ul>
<li>One of you is user 1, the other is user 2. User 1 goes first.</li>
<li>Depending on your section, run the appropriate experiment with your partner.</li>
<li>Use one computer to input your data.
</ul>
<!-- Your form should pre-populate with your results when you load it.-->
<!-- When you finish, your results will be uploaded to our server, and we'll aggregate the three experiments across the whole class. -->

<h3>2. Load Your Section's Game</h3>
<ul>
<li>Open the <a target="_blank" href="https://kixlab.org/courses/hci/activities/experiment-design/game/game.html">game</a> in a separate tab in your browser.</li>

</ul>
<!--
<ul>
<li><b>Section A: <a href="#sectionA">Between-subjects</a></b></li>
<li><b>Section B: <a href="#sectionB">Within-subjects, no counterbalancing</a></b></li>
<li><b>Section C: <a href="#sectionC">Within-subjects, randomized</a></b></li>
</ul>
-->
<h3>3. Answer thought questions about your condition:</h3>
<ul>
<li><h4 id="sectionA">Section A: Between Subjects</h4>
This game is <i>between subjects</i>. One of you was in one condition (typing dictionary words), and the other person was in a different condition (typing gibberish). Think about the advantages and disadvantages of this set up. Is it appropriate for this particular experiment? When might it be important to pick a between subjects experiment?
<br /></li>
<li>
<h4 id="sectionB">Section B: Within Subjects, fixed ordering</h4>
This game is <i>within subjects</i>. Each of you were in both conditions, and you <i>both</i> did the dictionary condition first, and then the gibberish condition. Since you both did this in the same order, this is <i>not</i> counterbalanced. Think about the advantages and disadvantages of this set up. Is it appropriate for this particular experiment? When might it be important to pick a within subjects experiment? When might you want or not want counterbalancing?
<br /></li>

<li><h4 id="sectionC">Section C: Within Subjects, randomized ordering</h4>
This game is <i>within subjects</i>. Each of you were in both conditions, and you were <i>randomly</i> shown words in each condition. Think about the advantages and disadvantages of this set up. Is it appropriate for this particular experiment? When might it be important to pick a within subjects experiment? When might you want or not want randomization of conditions?
<br /></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="moreQs">4. Answer these questions:</h3>
<ul><li>What were the independent variables and dependent variables in this experiment?</li>
<li>What about <i>other </i>variables that might affect the experiment -- which were you controlling for, and which were uncontrolled? What differences between each pair of people might threaten internal validity?</li>
<li>What are the ordering effects that might come into play in this task?<br>
<li>What biases in this experiment might be caused by your <i>expectations</i> about how it should turn out?
</li></ul>
