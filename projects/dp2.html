            <h2>What do we do?</h2>
            In this assignment, you will turn your needfinding results into concrete solution idea candidates. By going through the design process introduced in class and suggested below, you'll ensure that your ideas are grounded in the observations, needs, and insights you identified from real users. Specifically:<br/><br/>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Point of View (POV)</strong>: A point of view is a unique approach to the problem that is based on user needs and insights. As we have done in class, consider writing down users, needs, and insights from DP1 on the board and finding a unique connection between them, which reveals a meaningful challenge. <strong>Report one POV</strong> you will tackle for the rest of the semester. <a href="https://dschool-old.stanford.edu/wp-content/themes/dschool/method-cards/point-of-view-madlib.pdf">This method card</a> from Stanford d.school should be a useful resource.<br/><br/>
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Personas</strong>: Develop <strong>a persona</strong> for the imaginary user that's represented in your team's POV. The level of detail to include and how you want to present your persona is up to you, but note that you'll refer to this persona throughout your design process when making various design decisions. If there are multiple distinct personas your team has in mind, pick the most compelling one. Refer to the <a href="https://kixlab.org/courses/hci/classes/08-Ideation/#personas">course reading</a> for more details. Note the scenario part can be brief, as more detail will be covered in your storyboards.<br/><br/>
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>How Might We (HMW) Questions</strong>: HMW questions serve as a bridge between your POV and solution ideas. They are short questions that should be broad enough to allow for open ideas yet narrow enough to set meaningful boundaries. Reports <strong>at least 10 HMW questions</strong> for your team's POV, and pick <strong>top 3 HMW questions</strong>. <a href="https://dschool-old.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/HMW-METHODCARD.pdf">This method card</a> from Stanford d.school should be a useful resource.<br/><br/>
              </li>
              
              <li>
                <strong>Solution Ideas</strong>: Solution ideas are your attempts at solving the HMW questions. Use the brainstorming techniques covered in class for exploration. Report <strong>at least 10 solution ideas</strong> per each of the top 3 HMW questions, and pick <strong>top 3 solution ideas</strong> overall. Note that these 3 ideas should be <strong>distinct from one another</strong>, covering a wide solution space. The best ideas don't necessarily have to represent each HMW; multiple ideas can belong to a single HMW.<br/><br/>
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Storyboards</strong>: Create <strong>3 storyboard sketches</strong>, one for each of the top 3 solution ideas. A storyboard is a set of comic-strip-like drawings that visually walks through a concrete scenario and a task that your persona experiences. Show the challenge the persona encounters, what environment the persona is surrounded by, what motivates the persona to use the solution idea you're suggesting, and how your solution idea actually addresses the challenge. The storyboard shouldn't be about specific system features or UI elements. You don't even need to show the detailed screen layout of your UI at this point. Focus on the concept and context, rather than pretty UIs or sophisticated system features.<br/><br/>

                Make sure to hand-draw your storyboards, with a thick pen so that sketches are visible when digitally scanned and excessive details are not included. Using a pencil or a thin ball-point pen is not allowed. Here are some good examples (<a href="https://kixlab.org/courses/crowdsourcing/projects/verbivore/tasks-sketches-video/index.html">Verbivore</a> and <a href="https://kixlab.org/courses/crowdsourcing/projects/letsread/tasks-sketches-video/index.html">Let's Read</a>), except for the fact that some of them are not drawn with a thick pen. Also, Amal Dar Aziz's <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/courses/cs147/2009/assignments/storyboard_notes.pdf">guide to storyboarding</a> is a highly recommended resource. Finally, watch the first 6 minutes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgEm67KLIIM">this video</a> by Scott Klemmer, which gives a nice introduction to storyboarding.

            <h2>Deliverables</h2>
            <strong>Studio Presentation</strong>: In studio, your team will present your main findings for 5 minutes, with 5 minutes for Q&A and feedback. You need to prepare a Google Slides presentation, by adding your slides to the link your TA will send you. The slides should be sent to your TA by <strong>5pm on Monday</strong>. <strong>Every team member</strong> needs to participate in the presentation. Write down the questions and feedback you receive during your presentation, and reflect on them in your report.

            <br/><br/>

            <strong>Team Report</strong>: One report per team. Your report should be submitted as a zip file. The main report should be written in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> (please use the <em>.md</em> extension). We're going to publish your reports on the course website. Submit your team's report on <a href="http://klms.kaist.ac.kr/course/view.php?id=56631">KLMS</a>.
