            <h2>What do we do?</h2>
            Finally, it's time to present your design process and the resulting interface to other people, both orally and visually. During our final project showcase, each team will give a 3-minute presentation in front of the whole class. In addition, you'll create a maximum 2-minute video clip that captures user needs, tasks, and an interface walkthrough.

            <h2>Your Report</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Studio Presentation</strong>: (1) Summarize findings from your user testing, and (2) report progress on your iteration. For (2), it could be things you've already accomplished since user testing or plan to cover. Your studiomates and TA will provide feedback on how you might most effectively use the last week for the best outcome.</li><br/>
              
              <li><strong>Final Presentation</strong>: Decide what part of the design process you want to convey to the audience, for three minutes. Which part do you think is most exciting and strongest? What is your unique point of view on the problem, and why is your UI a usable and useful solution to the problem? You won't have time to explain details, so focus on the main points and lessons.<br/><br/>
              You should assume that the audience knows nothing about the problem space and your solution. Also keep in mind that we'll be listening to 20 talks non-stop in class: think how your presentation could stand out. Make sure to include a hook that will get people excited about your project. Avoid using much text and actively use visual artifacts from various stages of the design process. Here's a suggested flow:<br/>
              User needs and problems => Point of view => HMW question / solution => Main tasks => Representative UI screenshots or walkthrough (but no live demo is allowed) => Lessons from user testing<br/><br/>

              After the presentations, we'll hand out a few awards based on different categories, such as "most extreme user", "best implementation", "people's choice", etc.
              </li><br/>

              <li><strong>Video</strong>: Record a 2-minute video that captures the user context and the killer features of your UI. Be creative in how you plan, structrue, and record the video! Here's an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NniNjKXoh8">example</a>. Revisit your storyboards, as they capture the rich usage context. You need to set the stage by starting with users and their problem. Avoid using slides and try to capture realistic context, and don't hesitate to "act". Do not show the UI from the beginning. You need to show parts of your final prototype to demonstrate how the user might perform the task using your system. Rather than describe all the features you implemented, focus on the flow of the task.</li><br/>

              <li><strong>Final Report</strong>: The final report will be brief. You need to simply include the following: 
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Iteration</strong>: How did you spend the DP8 period for iteration? Why? What changes did you make? Show concrete examples and data whenever applicable. What did you learn?</li>
                  <li><strong>Individual reflection</strong>: Each member should write this part on their own, reflecting on their personal experience. Merge all members' mini-reports in the final report. Please answer the following questions:
                    <ul>
                      <li>What part of the UI implementation did you contribute to?</li>
                      <li>What worked well and not in your team? How did you overcome any hurdle in teamwork? What lesson about teamwork did you learn that you might apply to your next team project?</li>
                      <li>Throughout the team-based design project experience, what did you learn about the user-centered design process and web-based GUI implementation?</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h2>Deliverables</h2>
            <strong>Studio Presentation</strong>: In studio, your team will present your main findings for 5 minutes, with 5 minutes for Q&A and feedback. You need to prepare a Google Slides presentation, by adding your slides to the link your TA will send you. The slides should be sent to your TA by <strong>5pm on Monday</strong>. <strong>Every team member</strong> needs to participate in the presentation. Write down the questions and feedback you receive during your presentation, and reflect on them in your report.

            <br/><br/>

            <strong>Final presentation slides, a link to video, and the team report are all due by 1pm on 6/13 (Tue), right before our final project showcase.</strong>

            <br/><br/>

            <strong>Final Presentation</strong>: For smooth transition between presentations, we'll require all teams to use Google Slides for presentation, just like in studios. Each team will receive a link to a Google Slides presentation from the TA. During the final showcase, we will open your slides from our computer, and your team will have exactly 3 minutes to present. Please note that <strong>there will be a hard stop after 3 minutes</strong>: unfinished presentations will be cut off. We recommend that you rehearse in your team in advance. <strong>Every team member</strong> needs to participate in the presentation. 

            <br/><br/>

              <li>Encoded as an MP4 using the H.264 codec. No exceptions!</li>
              <li>You'll upload your video file on <a href="https://youtube.com/">YouTube</a>. Include the URL of your posted video in your final report. Also upload the original mp4 file on KLMS.</li>
              <li>All spoken dialog must be closed captioned (subtitled) to improve accessibility.</li>

            <br/>

            <strong>Team Report</strong>: One report per team. Your report should be submitted as a zip file. The main report should be written in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> (please use the <em>.md</em> extension). We're going to publish your reports on the course website. Submit your team's report on <a href="http://klms.kaist.ac.kr/course/view.php?id=56631">KLMS</a>.
