## Postmortem Notes

- Students made good observations about some university websites maintaining multiple layouts for different locales. The Univ. of Tokyo, for instance, has completely different layouts and content organization for their English and Japanese websites.
- A student mentioned that forms.py fails to load due to security issues in beta versions of Chrome.
- In the Javascript i18n exercise, some strings are not translated to French: "date", "price".
- In the Javascript i18n exercise, a student mentioned that currency formation should be applied the current exchange rate :)


## Announcements to write on board

+ certs: garble
+ non-certs: reside
+ RS1 due today
+ GR4 next Wed

## HoF (1:05, 8 mins)

Use case

- "Can I park here now?"
- "For how long?"

Existing signs

- high information density
- hard to scan

Graphical design

- Layout: grid-style design, time table (familiar way to parse time-related information)
- Time-intensive parking: yellow?
- Arrow: what for?
- Squint test: green and red colors.
- But green and red are bad combinations. Hatches have been added, which did not exist in the original designer's version.
- Time intervals are not uniform. Interval variables for time. But they are focusing on common use cases.
- Parking options are nominal.


Learnability

- intuitive calendar view that's familiar to many
- more visual, no jargon or dense text

Efficiency

- single view

Safety

Evaluation

- How to evaluate a new thing like this?
- 100 installations + ramp up if successful
- This is a common strategy for web interfaces

## Nanoquiz (1:13, 3 mins)


## Learning Objectives (1:16, 1 min)


## Internalization factors (1:17, 5 mins)
- brainstorm as class, write down on the board

### Differences among locales
- Culture
- Symbols
- Color
- Left->Right
- Formatting of number, date, currency
- Photos


## Activity: Internalization (1:22, 7 mins)
- high quality translation can be tricky
    - requires native speakers in both languages, plus a bilingual who does the translation, if you outsource.


## People's system usage can be affected. (1:30, 3 mins)
- The way people use Twitter between Korean and English users is quite different.
- Much more content can be entered in 140 Korean characters. People use Twitter almost as a short blog post sometimes, whereas in English


## Other Factors to Consider (1:33, 2 mins)
- ActiveX in Korea: IE + Windows
- Browser usage stats


## Activity: Cultural Comparison (1:35, 3 parts, 16 mins)


### Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory
- Let's try to conduct our own experiment looking at cultural differences.

- Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory is a framework for cross-cultural communication, developed by Geert Hofstede. It describes the effects of a society's culture on the values of its members, and how these values relate to behavior, using a structure derived from factor analysis.

- Power distance index (PDI): "Power distance is the extent to which the less powerful members of organizations and institutions (like the family) accept and expect that power is distributed unequally." Individuals in a society that exhibit a high degree of power distance accept hierarchies in which everyone has a place without the need for justification. Societies with low power distance seek to have equal distribution of power. [6]Cultures that endorse low power distance expect and accept power relations that are more consultative or democratic.
- Individualism (IDV) vs. collectivism: "The degree to which individuals are integrated into groups". In individualistic societies, the stress is put on personal achievements and individual rights. People are expected to stand up for themselves and their immediate family, and to choose their own affiliations. In contrast, in collectivist societies, individuals act predominantly as members of a lifelong and cohesive group or organization (note: "The word collectivism in this sense has no political meaning: it refers to the group, not to the state"). People have large extended families, which are used as a protection in exchange for unquestioning loyalty.
- Uncertainty avoidance index (UAI): "a society's tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity". It reflects the extent to which members of a society attempt to cope with anxiety by minimizing uncertainty. People in cultures with high uncertainty avoidance tend to be more emotional. They try to minimize the occurrence of unknown and unusual circumstances and to proceed with careful changes step by step planning and by implementing rules, laws and regulations. In contrast, low uncertainty avoidance cultures accept and feel comfortable in unstructured situations or changeable environments and try to have as few rules as possible. People in these cultures tend to be more pragmatic, they are more tolerant of change.
- Masculinity (MAS), vs. femininity: "The distribution of emotional roles between the genders". Masculine cultures' values are competitiveness, assertiveness, materialism, ambition and power, whereas feminine cultures place more value on relationships and quality of life. In masculine cultures, the differences between gender roles are more dramatic and less fluid than in feminine cultures where men and women have the same values emphasizing modesty and caring. As a result of the taboo on sexuality in many cultures, particularly masculine ones, and because of the obvious gender generalizations implied by Hofstede's terminology, this dimension is often renamed by users of Hofstede's work, e.g. to Quantity of Life vs. Quality of Life.


- Power distance index shows very high scores for Latin and Asian countries, African areas and the Arab world. On the other hand Anglo and Germanic countries have a lower power distance (only 11 for Austria and 18 for Denmark). For example, the United States has a 40 on the cultural scale of Hofstede's analysis. Compared to Guatemala where the power distance is very high (95) and Israel where it is very low (13), the United States is in the middle. In Europe, power distance tends to be lower in northern countries and higher in southern and eastern parts: for example, 68 in Poland and 57 for Spain vs. 31 for Sweden and 35 for the United Kingdom.
- Regarding the individualism index, there is a clear gap between developed and Western countries on one hand, and less developed and eastern countries on the other. North America and Europe can be considered as individualistic with relatively high scores: for example, 80 for Canada and Hungary. In contrast, Asia, Africa and Latin America have strongly collectivist values: Colombia scores only 13 points on the IDV scale and Indonesia 14. The greatest contrast can be drawn comparing two extreme countries on this dimension: 6 points for Guatemala vs. 91 points for the United States. Japan and the Arab world have middle values on this dimension.
- Uncertainty avoidance scores are the highest in Latin American countries, Southern and Eastern Europe countries including German speaking countries, and Japan. They are lower for Anglo, Nordic, and Chinese culture countries. However few countries have very low UAI. For example, Germany has a high UAI (65) and Belgium even more (94) compared to Sweden (29) or Denmark (23) despite their geographic proximity.
- Masculinity is extremely low in Nordic countries: Norway scores 8 and Sweden only 5. In contrast, Masculinity is very high in Japan (95), and in European countries like Hungary, Austria and Switzerland influenced by German culture. In the Anglo world, masculinity scores are relatively high with 66 for the United Kingdom for example. Latin countries present contrasting scores: for example Venezuela has a 73 point score whereas Chile's is only 28.

## HoF OLD

Our Hall of Fame or Shame candidate for the day is this interface for choosing how a list of database records should be sorted.  Let’s discuss its advantages and disadvantages, and contemplate alternative designs.

Like other sorting interfaces, this one allows the user to select more than one field to sort on, so that if two records are equal on the primary sort key, they are next compared by the secondary sort key, and so on.

On the plus side, this interface communicates one aspect of its model very well.  Each column is a set of radio buttons, clearly grouped together (both by gestalt proximity and by an explicit raised border). Radio buttons have the property that only one can be selected at a time.  So the interface has a clear affordance for picking only one field for each sort key.

But, on the down side, the radio buttons don’t afford making NO choice.  What if I want to sort by only one key?  I have to resort to a trick, like setting all three sort keys to the same field.  The interface model clearly doesn’t map correctly to the task it’s intended to perform. In fact, unlike typical model mismatch problems, both the user and the system have to adjust to this silly interface model – the user by selecting the same field more than once, and the system by detecting redundant selections in order to avoid doing unnecessary sorts.

The interface also fails on minimalist design grounds.  It wastes a huge amount of screen real estate on a two-dimensional matrix, which doesn’t convey enough information to merit the cost.  The column labels are similarly redundant; “sort option” could be factored out to a higher level heading.  The term “Primary” is not really consistent with “Second” and “Third”; “First” would be simpler.
