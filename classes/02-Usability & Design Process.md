5 stages: quick intro

Intro of the task


"Design for someone in your table"

"What is the last gift you gave"
- remembering, deciding, finding, purchasing, giving, returning, etc.

"Redesign your PARTNER's experience. That's your user."

1. 
A interviews B, B=>A will be a separate time so focus on the current role.


2. Seek stories, emotions, feelings, & motivations
"Get your partner to cry"
Not data, not market research
"Focus on the personal experience."
Ask "Why" a lot.

3. Individual reflection
needs and insights from the conversation
=> needs: what your user is trying to accomplish, in verbs
=> insights: not sure how yet, but unexpected nuggets that you like to leverage

Come up with a list, make it messy and rough

4. Articulate the problem statement
From your needs, pick the most interesting one
From you insights, pick the most interesting one
Make it concise.
Remember, it's just a prototype of a statement.
Short, specific, sexy!

5. don't use text
DRAW: crummy
go for quantity
explore the possibilities, not the right answer
37

ask how many people came up with
=> go from 3, 4, ==> xxx

SWITCH SEATS with the partner

6. share your sketches
A shows their work, B hides their sketch for now.
Doesn't matter if your likes it.
DO NOT DEFEND. LISTEN.
Learn more about your partner.

7. Iterate
Some were cool, others were probably bad.
Pull into a single new sketch.

8. Build
2D to 3D now.
Bring life into your sketch.
Physical, tangible prototype your user can actually interact with.

You feel you're not done. It's a good thing.

9. Feedback grid.
Again, more deeply understand your user.
Give it to your user's hand.
Write down any interesting comments and observations.


In an hour, 
even with crappy materials, you really got into it.


Now zoom out, look at the process again.
Think what you have done.

"Human-centered in the way you work"
- Have empathy.
- Go for latent needs.

Prototype everything!
- Test what's working and what's not.

Be more collaborative. It's a team sport.

Have a bias toward ACTION.
- Thinking through => get up, get out, talk to people, act.

Group questions
- how did engaging with real person change the direction of your prototype?

- what was it like to show unfinished prototype to another human being?

- how did the pace feel?

- what would you do next with the prototype? which stage would you go back to?

- one thing you'd like to try out tomorrow?

SLIDES
- show time on the slides
- have an alarm
- play some music?
- walk around and take photos, listen
