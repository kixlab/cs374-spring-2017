comment from last year's Piazza:

120% leading is too small
 
Use generous leading, but not too generous. 120% of the font size is a good rule of thumb; this would correspond to the 20/24 leading shown on the previous slide.
This is actually too small for most cases, especially on the Web. Visit any modern big website and inspect the line-height where there is a lot of body text (headings and large text are a different beast) and it will almost always be larger than 120%. I just tried it with a few big websites:
TechCrunch: 1.625
CNN.com: 1.4444
Facebook (posts): 1.38
Amazon: 1.6
Twitter: 1.375
Reddit: 1.43
Imdb: 1.4
Wikipedia: 1.6
 
(Note how the ones with the smallest line-height are Twitter and Facebook, since usually their posts are relatively small.)
 
Even in the reading itself, line-height is 180%!!
 
In addition, the W3C accessibility guidelines (WCAG) state:
Many people with cognitive disabilities have trouble tracking lines of text when a block of text is single spaced. Providing spacing between 1.5 to 2 allows them to start a new line more easily once they have finished the previous one.
and:
Line spacing (leading) is at least space-and-a-half within paragraphs, and paragraph spacing is at least 1.5 times larger than the line spacing. [source]
