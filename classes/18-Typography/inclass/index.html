## Postmortem Notes

- Timing of the activities and talk points worked very well.
- For the logo design exercise, the Confluence wiki had issues where some students experienced timeout errors, probably due to hundreds of requests in a burst.


## Announcements to write on board

+ Nanoquiz: archive


## HoF (1:05, 7 mins)

Google Drive is an online storage, where you can store documents, photos, etc.It takes a desktop file manager metaphor for web documents and folders that are synchronized across all shared users. A design challenge is in combining the familiar desktop file management language with the online sharing language.

Consider the web interface for Google Drive. Analyze its usability with respect to:

- Graphical layout: the squint test, visual variables, spacing, etc.
    - accent color: red, blue
    - two-column layout
    - simplistic design
    - generous use of space between items
- Adherence to user interface conventions
    - consistency across different Google apps
    - desktop metaphor
- Simplicity (what functionality is offered, how simply is it expressed?)
- Learnability and efficiency; information scent
    - "Shared with Me", "Starred", "Recent"


### Main panel
- Icons: shared folders, document types, users
- Color: monochromatic, shade of gray for less important (last modifier)
- Breadcrumb: visual cue about where the user is, good information scent
- Typographical emphasis: bold for selected sorting criterion


### Sidebar (Old sidebar vs New sidebar)

- Icons: part of typography
    - Easier to notice, consistent visual language
- Simplified "NEW" button
    - Having both "Create" and "Upload" is confusing. The mental model or the overall goal of the user is to "Add" something in both cases.
- Spacing
    - More visual space, probably larger target area. Good because there's enough space.
- Color
    - Gray background in the sidebar visually separates it from the main panel
- Font
    - "Roboto" vs default Sans-serif


## Nanoquiz (1:12, 3 mins)


## Learning Objectives (1:15, 1 min)
- pattern in how we approach different design-related topics in this class (layout, color, typography, etc.)
    - low-level understanding: how the human cognitive process works
    - high-level design considerations (identity, aesthetics, emotion)


## Why typography matters? (1:16, 3 mins)
- brainstorm different factors with class

- identity: luxury brands vs tech companies,
- readability
- aesthetics
- affect
- appropriateness
- safety


### Gap logo (1:19, 2 mins)
One of the most disastrous rebranding efforts in the past decade came in 2010,
when the Gap tried to cast off its bold 1969 logo for something in a generic sans-serif font with a blue square.
The idea was for the Gap to look younger, fresher, and more "social media,"
but it was roundly criticized online.
The company went back to the old familiar logo after just a week.

### Save money (1:21, 1 mins)
Saving ink


## Readability (1:22, 3 mins)
- define fixations, saccades, comprehension (mention subvocalization: reading to yourself)
- brainstorm ways to handle whitespacing
    - kerning, tracking, line height, leading


### Speed reading (1:25, 3 mins)
- http://squirt.io/
- why does this work / not work?
    - discuss saccade, fixation, subvocalization
    - shorten time for saccades
    - comprehension may be hard (no easy access to missed words)

- Skimming: Skimming is to glance through text to find important parts to read. Although this is usually considered a speed reading method, you're not teaching yourself to read faster. You're just learning which parts you can skip over. As you'd expect, studies show that we don't remember that many details when we skim.
- Meta guiding is one of the older techniques. It's when you use a finger (or a pointer like a pen) to guide your eyes to specific words. The point is to decrease distraction and focus on the specific words to increase your reading speed.
- RSVP: Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) is a method used by most of the recent digital speed reading systems. Single words flash on the screen so you're concentrating on a single word at a time. As you get used to the system, you speed up how fast the display shows you words.

## Activity: Readability Enhancement (1:30, 5 min, 3 min discussion)
- ask for size and weight suggestions first
- play with width and line-height showing good and bad
- suggest that the paragraph needs to
- ask for font faces

### Is comic sans actually bad? (1:38, 3 mins)
- appropriateness
    - overuse could be a problem

### Clearview (1:41, 5 mins)
- Highway Gothic to Clearview
- Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l46fb_hn6yE
    - Watch from the beginning to 2:15

- What are the design factors that designers took into account?
    - problem they're solving: night driving, older drivers
    - potential alternative solution is to increase the size: The government’s highway engineers proposed increasing the size of the letters by 20 percent. But larger letters would mean even larger signs, a costly and cumbersome venture that would do little but increase visual clutter on the roadway. “You’re talking about billions of dollars,” Meeker said, explaining that on signs what is taller is also wider. “It wouldn’t just be a question of replacing the signs and all their support structures, but you would have to widen lanes and redo overpasses to make room for these things.”
    - study to demonstrate improvements is crucial: In nighttime tests, Clearview showed a 16 percent improvement in recognition over Highway Gothic, meaning drivers traveling at 60 miles per hour would have an extra one to two seconds to make a decision.
    - legible from far away: open spaces.

Clearview is a sans-serif face, meaning the terminal points of its letters lack any ornamental lines, wedges and other shapes. It wasn’t until the 1920s that sans-serif came into wide use with typefaces like Futura and later, in the ’50s, Helvetica, but they are now the typeface style of choice for any design job requiring a clean, vaguely futuristic aesthetic. The clear, pristine shapes of sans-serif fonts grab the eye in an instant, lending themselves to advertising copy and large, punchy headlines as well as highway signs. But in large blocks of text, the detailed edges of the letter forms in serif fonts give the type an easy-to-follow flow reminiscent of cursive script, making them the preferred typeface for newspapers, magazines and books.
