Project Name	Font Name	Why did you pick this font for this project?
(smoke) free	Press Start 2P	It seems like it should be comicky.
༼ ºل͟º༼ ºل͟º ༽ºل͟º ༽ºل͟º ༽	Open Sans	Matches the modern look and feel I got from your paper prototype
༼ ºل͟º༼ ºل͟º ༽ºل͟º ༽ºل͟º ༽	Lato	Modern, simple font seems best for a way to technologically order something like instructions
3 Peas in a Pod	Bree Serif 	looks trustworthy and professional but not aloof
3 Peas in a Pod	Montserrat	I think it suits the playful feel of pets.
3 Peas in a Pod	Calligraffitti	Peas is a weird word, and hard to find a font that doesn't make it look strange.  It seemed like the team wanted to make something warm and approachable yet trustworthy, which led to my favoring of an slightly slanted script.
3 Peas in a Pod	Lobster	it is a cute font that looks memorable and is appropriate for something pet related
3 Peas in a Pod	Jura	Looks techy
3 Peas in a Pod	Skia	It's just friendly enough to fit with the not-so-serious team name, but looks just professional enough to suggest that they would be a trustworthy resource for connecting people to pet sitters.
3 Peas in a Pod	Montserrat by Julieta	Seems formal enough but also interesting and not overused. Wasn't really enough time to do an in depth analysis of your project.
99 Victors but Victor Ain't One	Noto Sans	Clean and simple, like how you hope the process to be
99 Victors but Victor Ain't One	News Cycle	Simple, clean, easy-to-use, modern also your project name is funny but not descriptive of your project lol
99 Victors but Victor Ain't One	Bangers	whimsical font for a whimsical name
99 Victors but Victor Ain't One	Alfa Slab One	I just based it on the name because my computer is slow and couldn't open your wiki.
99 Victors but Victor Ain't One	Varela	This is a clear font for labels and instructions.
99 Victors but Victor Ain't One	Alegreya Sans	Nice clean font with few frills.  The site is not about artsy stuff, so it doesn't need an artsy font.
99 Victors but Victor Ain't One	roboto slam	easy to read for a long title
99 Victors but Victor Ain't One	Covered By Your Grace	This site is about volunteering and this font looks like signs hand-written for volunteer events.
99 Victors but Victor Ain't One	Architects Daughter	This application has a more playful name, which is reflected in the font. 
99 Victors but Victor Ain't One	Alegreya	I was trying to find a traditional looking serif, but ran out of time for one that I really liked. I might also try performing some kind of distinction between "99 victors' and "but Victor Ain't one", as the word "victor" has a really traditional feel to it but "ain't" is very very casual. This difference in feel in the title might be accented by including two different fonts in the logo.
99 Victors but Victor Ain't One	Optima	It's a modern-looking sans-serif font, but it's somewhat informal looking, in line with their pop-culture-referencing team name.
à¼¼ ÂºÙ„ÍŸÂºà¼¼ ÂºÙ„ÍŸÂº à¼½ÂºÙ„ÍŸÂº à¼½ÂºÙ„ÍŸÂº à¼½	Lora	It gives solid "/"s for the fractions which I felt was most important
Aika	Dancing Script	The project is for photography artists. Thus I chose a font which has a art sense in it.
Aika	Lobster	The wiki is being particularly slow and not loading, so I don't have the context of the problem statement to help. However, this font is bold, solid, and looks nice on short selections of text, which fits Aika well.
Aika	Poiret One	The project is web design for artists. This light, sans-serif font is elegant and visually appealing. 
Aika	Shadows Into Light	http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Shadows+Into+Light  It's light, and looks handwritten and gives an "artsy", "designed" feel to it.
Aika	Hind	It just feels like "professional" and "art"
Aika	Lobster	The project is related to artistic work, and Lobster seems to adhere to that tone while remaining fairly readable.
Aika	Kaushan Script	For professional artist, the font resembles brush strokes of varying stroke width and is still clear to read for professionalism 
Aika	Lato	It looked professional, but not overly serious or formal. It was clean with a hint of fun. 
Aika	Khand All Caps	This is a very clean, modern font that would appeal to designers. 
Aika	Poiret One	They are making it for artists, I chose something that was light-weight to not seem forceful to artists, also clean
aJACKS	Slabo	This font conveys a serious tone with its serifs and thing strokes. This is good, sinve ourbiggest user group would be professors
aJACS	Slabo	It looks good with the 4 letter name.
aJACS	Roboto Slab	no nonsense but looks great on capital letters (important for you)
aJACS	Lato	it seems very easy to read due to the kerning on the font (which is helpful for older professors) and appears very professional. Therefore I believe it would be a good font for an application designed to help professors and TAs with learning names
aJACS	Caslon	From viewing the groups prototypes, it seems that they will be displaying many names at a single time.  I think a serif font would make readability much easier when displaying many names all at once.  However, if the group decides to display not as many names at a time, a sans-serif font may be more appropriate given that a name is generally more like a label or important feature.
aJACS	Lora	Looks classic and professional, like a professor may use it
aJACS	Hammersmith One	This would be a good font for names because it is halfway between a title font and a body font. It calls attention to itself, but it could be used in a short list or next to a photo.
aJACS	Indie Flower	The project aims to solve the problem of professors not remembering the names of their students so i thought Indie Flower, which actually makes the project name hard to read (and thus remember), kind of mimics this difficulty. 
aJACS	Open Sans Condensed	It has a clean feel to it, which fits with their clean interface.
aJACS	Oswald	aJACS was I think taken from the team member names, to just be a cool-sounding, quirky, modern name with the feel of cool/important abbreviations. Oswald does this (it is tall, bold, (important), quirky, modern (no serif)).
Aladdin	Droid Sans	Again, I thought that the way this font was spaced and displayed, it was very easy to recognize whole words.
Aladdin	Amatic SC	Looks kid friendly and fun
Aladdin	Shadows Into Light	Aladdin helps parents keep track of information about their children; I wanted a playful font to reflect that.
Aladdin	Carme	clean, sans serif font, to make people think it is trustworthy and modern.
Aladdin	Cinzel	The project is about overseeing your children's lives, so Aladdin needs a font that is professional and reassuring. I think Cinzel gives them the authoritative, professional look with all caps, plus it's a serif, which gives it that reassuring, familiar feel. It may need a color that makes it softer (more inviting).
Aladdin	Coming Soon	reminds me of children, which is the main theme of the project
Aladdin	Cantata One	It looks traditional and secure, like a big established company you can trust with important stuff.
Apollo	Oswald	i can't access the wiki, but the font looks cool for the word "apollo"!
Apollo	Domine	Easy to read but stands out as different from default fonts, shows you made an effort to find font instead of just using default, but also not different enough to cause reading problems
Apollo	Orbitron	I chose this font because Apollo is a space related name and this font as a space feel to it.
Apollo	Slabo, Titillium Web, Maven pro	since it's a website for cancer patients. I decided to go for a more professional simplistic font. 
Apollo	Bangers	The bangers font is all caps, and it fits the Apollo name in the sense that "Apollo" has a lot of meaning embedded in it. Apollo was a momentous moment in human history, and it should be such for this log as well.
Apollo	Cabin	Sans serif fonts are good for headers/logos, and Cabin strikes a good balance between professional and casual, suitable for something for personal medical use.
Asian on Occasion	Nunito	idk
Asian on Occasion	Open Sans Condensed	It looks professional, which would add credibility, and it is spaced fairly small so that the long name is more condensed
Asian on Occasion	Tangerine	This font had an oriental feel to it 
Asian on Occasion	Indie Flower	It looks very oriental
Asian on Occasion	Lora	professional and classy, serious topic so can't be too childish
Asian on Occasion	Josefin Sans	Font has good spacing, making it appear to have less value, but still not too "serious"/"classical".
Asian on Occasion	Special Elite	Your project is about helping smokers- special elite has that serious/grunge/vibe that a self-help for smokers website might want to look into
Assure	Archivo Narrow	It shows sincerity
Assure	Playball	This font feels reassuring and welcoming which is important for the users because they are entrusting important people to this project
Assure	Lato	http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lato  This is a very clean font that is very easy to read.
Assure	Patua One	The heavy weight and solid positioning (no slanting) evokes seriousness and dependability. The value is dark.
Assure	Arvo	Since the project is for grad students, the font can be a bit less traditional, but still convey reliability.
Assure	Garamond	Budgeting app or anything with financials should have a proper and easily readable font.
Assure	Lora	Went for something simple, professional, and eliciting trust.
Assure	Playfair Display	looks professional and reliable, which is necessary for your topic
Assure	Bitter	The fon't has strong value and looks formal with all the serifs, making it suitable for a financial application.
blank text box	Open Sans	its a playful, modern text 
Blank Text Box	Marvel	Because this font has high ascenders, get it? it's an app for climbers.
Blank Text Box	Lora	A serif font is actually pretty appropriate for such a meta team name.
Blank Text Box	Technical Medium	Its a fun font for rock climbing.
Blank Text Box	Oxygen	No serifs. Quick and easy to read
Blank Text Box	Josefin Sans	Blank Text Box is simple, so is the font
Blank Text Box	Open Sans Condensed	 and Poiret One, Abel  any boxy one
Blank Text Box	Josefin Sans	Blank Text Box is simple, so is the font
Blank Text Box- Climb Your World	Cabin	Easy to read and stands out
Chupacabras	Yanone Kaffeesatz	Chupacabras sounds like a project that is intended to be more fun than serious.  This font reflects that.
chupacabras	nova round	professional yet modern and minimalist
Chupacabras	Russo One	I chose this font because it's bold, but also seems sort of tech-y, and this team's UI is a social platform for discussing stocks. I think the font conveys seriousness as well as socialness at the same time, with the tech aspect also bringing a "social media" idea to mind.
Climb Your World	Oswald	Because its tall and skinny like something I would want to climb
Climb your World	alegreya	I think that it is a really cool font. It feels really solid, something that ould be important for a rock climbing company.
Climb Your World	Fjalla One	It's tall and bold, appropriate for rock climbers, and also is simple and direct and not elaborate or artsy.
Climb Your World	Questria	It's a serif font for a more active, less businessy audience, with a lot of rounded letters that suggest rock climbing textures.
Clover	Nunito	The font shows amenity, which is suitable for the project given it aims to provide care to beloved ones.
Clover	Coming Soon	Because it seems caring
Clover	Allerta	Modern, trust-able, conveys reliability. (It's for a health-care application.)
Clover	Lobster	I would use the lobster font with a dark green color that might represent the color of a clover. I think this font goes well with the name clover since it looks natural and handwritten
Clover	Caudex	The users may include older users, so I wanted something that looked classic and not too childish. This font has a nice, simple look, and the spacing is wider than other classic looking fonts, which may help older people see the different letters more clearly
deadbeef pancakes	Lato	I did it randomly because your page wouldn't load TT
deadbeef pancakes	Lora	The project is intended for helping teachers. Thus, the font should be professional looking and easy to read. 
deadbeef pancakes	Lora	Has a serious mode and tone that matches the feel of your app
DormUp	Source Sans Pro	Feels softer and cleaner than other fonts, a good sans serif that conveys a fun but efficient site.
DormUp	Optima	Its a good font for efficiency.
DormUp	PT Sans	This font is easy to read especially for students. It will resonate well for dorms and to attract attention.
DormUp	Londrina Shadow	It's got a playful "playground" feel to it, and its deep shadows make it almost 3D are reminiscent of the actual dorm building. 
DormUp	Changa One	looks official, efficient
DormUp	Patua One	Wanted to go with a university or college related font since it will be primarily used in dorms.
DormUp	Droid Sans	It is sans serif, haarkening to the young people managing the front desk, with enough seriousness to reflect the responsibility of the job.
DormUp	Droid Sans	The font should look like it's more modern, since this is supposed to be a technological solution to a traditional paper problem.
Final Four	Monteserrat	It looked large and powerful, signaling the finality of the title. The sans serif nature leads to a refined and no nonsense feel. 
Final Four	Scripps College Old Style	professional, looks "academic"
Final Four	Muli	It looks clean. The font is a sans-serif with good spacing
Final Four	Karma	It has a cool name. It has serifs which improve readability, and good spacing. I also like how it looks (some subjective preference there)
Final Four	Cabin	It has a good balance between formality and lightness
foodie	Kaushan Script	It is a sans serif font, and I've seen this font used for food-related items before, so users will be more likely to associate this font with food.
foodies	Lobster	They're creating an interface that makes it easy to plan study breaks between GRTs, students, etc. Lobster reminds me of a nice, classy restaurant - a place that you would be relaxing, where the service is easy and attentive (as their interface should be)
foodies	Casual	It's friendly and not very serious, which fits with the premise of having "a fun study break".
foodies	lobster	It's fast and dark and confident, just like foodies.
Foodies	Shadows Into Light	The font looks goofy in a nice kind of way, and appears to be something you can make using noodles. So I think it relates well to the food theme :)
foodies	Rock Salt	The project seeks to bring a little bit of fun during otherwise times -- the use of a handwritten font achieves that end, as well as reducing any degree of seriousness in the UI (I shouldn't feel like eating with GRTs and my neighbors is "an event"; it should be more low-key)
foodies	Roboto Slab	The spacing reduces the value of the block of text. The serifs improve readability.
foodies	Roboto Condensed	Easy to read and fit the personality of the project
foodies	"Chewy"	Chewy is a fun, fluid, sans-serif choice that seems to reflect Foodies' hassle-free promise
foodies	Lobster	I thought this font had a food and cuisine like style to it.
foodies	Comic Sans MS	Nothing is more evocative of the high school cafeteria experience than copious use of Comic Sans
Game Plan	ITC Sportbet	sporty and active
Game Plan	Arial	This project focuses on providing athletic coaches an easy way to create and share plays and timing details with their teams. As a result, I would choose a standard font type because there likely will be a lot of data contained that the team will be looking at so the font must be legible and readable so that they can easily to scan through the listings and find the information they are looking for.
Game Plan	Audiowide	similar to ESPN font, since this is a basketball-oriented application
Game Plan	open sans condensed	lightweight, feels 'basketbally' to me.
Game Plan	Fredoka One	Relaxed, but also sincere
Game Plan 	Quicksand	This style reminds me of a sports logo, which would go well in conveying the mood and sports-relatedness of Game Plan. Also, it is easy to read and professional looking. 
Gho	Passion One	it looks commandeering
Gho	Lato	I think it has visual consistency between letters and is easy to read.
Gho	Indie Flower	I couldn't reach the wiki during class, so I decided to pretend like Gho had something to do with Ghosts, and the Indie Flower font had a wavy feel, as if it had something to do with ghosts. 
Gho	Exo	Want something clear and understandable that stands out.
Gho	Open Sans	It's modern. Product is for people that want to get into running- it's important that they think the product and process is simple and easy to use. Open Sans speaks simplicity.
Gho	quicksand	it seems like it would be easy to read at a glance (good for someone who is running?)
Gho	PT Sans bold italic	Bold and italic suggest strength and motion.  PT Sans looked nice among bold italic fonts.
Gho 	Ubuntu 	It's modern and the lack of serif makes the text seem 'faster' (i.e. flow better). 
Group A	Trebuchet MS	This project focuses on easing the process for new parents to prepare for the arrival of a new born. As a result, I would use a font type that provides a tone that is welcoming and comforting.
Group A	Sans Serif	Modern and connotation of hip and playful, but not too playful like comic sans, so that it can still be used by adults (mothers)
Group A	Open Sans	At a quick glance, I was able to recognize the words quicker than other fonts
Group A	Oswald	It looks professional
Group A	Normal 400	It is a trustworthy, classic looking serif font - since the product is for families expecting newborn children, trustworthiness is of primary importance
Group A	Lobster, 1	Based on the problem statement, the team is trying to appeal to young adults who are creating a new family. This generation is used to social media and I believe that a font that is similar to that of pinterest might attract users since they will also see the application as a resourceful one where there is a sence of community.
Group A	Lobster	Fancy font seems good for an occasion like baby births
Group A	Vollkorn	It has softer edges, which seems to make sense for your project description, but it still is fairly clean.
Group A	Comfortaa	For the logo, I think it'd look open and inviting, and modern 
Group A	Fontdiner swanky	Eye-catching, looks friendly
Grouper	Oxygen	clear and readable without being too stuffy
Grouper	Lato	The font should be sans-serif to emphasize functionality over elegance.  Among these, Lato looks moderate and fresh, as the experience of working in a well-chosen group should be.
Grouper	Shadows into light	It feels handwritten - marker type font. Markers are used extensively in groups for things like nametags and this project seeks to replace some of the handwritten, manual work in group making
Grouper	Poiret One	Grouper is a tool to group people (in round bubbles).  I picked a sans serif because it is more fitting given the interface they plan to design.  Can have a color scheme same as project   Poiret One in bold may look good and fitting in the lightweight easy to use product    * VAG Rounded™  (this one would make it so similar to groupon) 
Grouper	Poiret One	the thin, elegant font works well with the idea of 'Grouper', which is trying to deliver a lightweight app with high functionality. This theme is conveyed through the sharpness (focus) of the font and the light strokes. 
Grouper	Fjalla One	Although in this font the letters are "skinny", since the idea of the project is an app that groups together people of different diversities, having a title that the letters are grouped together is pretty cool.
Grouper	Cabin Condensed or Hammersmith One	I think this is a readable font that gives off professionalism and reliability.
Grouper	Six Caps	The name is a single word, my idea was to make the single word look somewhat authoritative. It doesn't need to be the most clear thing ever, as the word is pretty simple on it's own.
Grouper	Montserrat	It feels futuristic, while still being approachable.
Grouper	Merriweather	This font shows regularity, which is good for a project like this for organizing events and teams.
Grouper	Hind	This is a clean but not overly professional font that is goup for a casual aplication.
Help a Mother Out	Source Sans Pro	I picked this font because it's sans-serif, which means it's not very fancy (I think the title of the project should look down to earth), but the curves in the letters are still friendly and not super serious.
Hidden Subtext	Hind	It's easy to read (important for subtitles/captions) and looks professional. It would be nice if the font of the subtitles (which is important to be readable) were consistent with that of the interface.
Hidden Subtext	Alfa Slab One	The font is very bold to contrast with the idea of the name
Hidden Subtext	Roboto Condensed	The narrow font suggests "hidden" text but doesn't give up too much readability.
Hidden Subtext	Press Start 2P	Didn't have time to read through project  but the title is super cryto kinda nerdy.    Probably not actually good for the font.  
Hidden Subtext	Roboto	We want to prioritize both approachability and readability.
Internal Consistency	Montserrat	It looks clean and professional, which is what you want out of an interface that's supposed to help keep your house in order
Internal Consistency	EB Garamond	Looks serious, like Internal Consistency
Internal Consistency	BenchNine	Font has a serious kind of look that appears unique and professional. I think it matches the serious/professional purpose of your app. 
Internal Consistency	PT Serif	Since the project is aim to help with communication between students and house team/house managers, reliability is an important quality. I think the logo should seem trustworthy and formal. Therefore I chose a serif font that also doesn't look too traditional. 
Internal Consistency 	Fjalla One	The project name seems like the font should be bold rigid.
Jane	Gloria Hallelujah	It has a childish, handwritten appearance, but the letters are very distinct from each other, so it could still be readable when used in a long url.
Jane	Cuprum	The project is mostly for parents for their kids, so it should convey a sense of reliability
Jane	Indie Flower	Jane provide safe internet browsing for children, and Indie Flower looks like a child's handwriting.
Jane	Hammersmith One	It's dark and easy for children to read.  
JANE	Ribeye	Looks playful and childish
Jane	Architects Daughter	This font is cute and like kid drawing. The project is designed for both parents and young kids.
Jane	Amatic SC, Josefin Sans	I chose two colors for their consideration.  Amatic SC is meant for the children to see. It is playful and emphasize exploration.   Josefin Sans looks more professional, but it still maintains the playfulness and helpfulness.
Jane	Nunito OR Muli	These both seem to work well for a parent-to-child app.
Jordan's Inner Circle	Dancing Script 	The name of the project is pretty informal. It's supposed to be for wedding planning, so you'd want something that looks refined and elegant over utilitarian. 
Jordan's Inner Circle	Playfair Display	The font weight is pretty light which makes it easy to read but the serifs make it look official. I think it would fit well with the project
Jordan's Inner Circle	Pinyon Script	It looks fancy, and since it is the wedding industry it fits.
Jordan's Inner Circle	Lora	Looks slightly fancier cause this is for a wedding, but still has the simple organized appearance needed for something that will help people organize
Jordan's Inner Circle	Pacifico	Your project is about wedding planning...Pacifico has that vibe
Jordan’s Inner Circle	Pinyon Script	Weddings tend to be associated with script fonts that imitate calligraphy (think of wedding invitations).  Runner up: Petit Formal Script
KEEM	Oswald	The font looks like it could make for a good headline and it think it would show off "Showcase" well.
KEEM	Merriweather	Artists want to show their works professionally, but they are still artists so they still want it to reflect some creativity or something.  The serifs convey a traditional and perhaps more credible feel and the thin line thickness makes it feel more free and creative maybe.
Kids Learning Together	Coming Soon	It looks like a kid's handwriting...
KLT	Covered By Your Grace	It's a cute font for kids.
KLT	Pacifico	The group's target population is kids, and so a serif font would seem too formal for something that should be fun and intriguing. Pacifico has a bit of childish feel to it, which fits
KLT 	PT Sans 	I chose this font because it seems fun and inviting, which works with KLT's desire to make a product/webpage that helps children be more motivated to learn on their own. 
KLT (kids learning together)	Shadows Into Light Two	young, child-like handwriting but still readable
KLT (Kids Learning Together)	Indie Flower	Very playful and young! Informal.
KLT (Kids Learning Together)	Poiret One	I chose this because it has a lighter feeling about it
KLT (Kids Learning Together)	Oxygen	This project is about children, and this font is readable while having a young, playful feel.
KLT (Kids Learning Together)	Playfair Display	The font has some style, which makes it more interesting to children, but is professional enough that it seems educational.
Lacah	Rock Salt	it looks badass
Lacah	Merriweather	I chose this font because it needed to both be modern (because the project aims to speed up efficiency) and because it needed to look official (because it is a medical project). The combination of clean lines and serifs make that happen.
Lacah	Tinos	It's a distinctive but still serious font. I would trust my health with someone who used Tinos!
Lacah	PT Serif	It is a nice bold and strong fond that represents the project goal. It also has a more modern feel which would be nice
Lacah	PT Serif	It is a nice bold and strong fond that represents the project goal. It also has a more modern feel which would be nice
Lacah	Cabin	It looks very simple, which would help convey the streamlining of information
Lacah	Linden Hill	https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/linden-hill  Serif for seriousness. But more modern than usual serifs (to show that it's a new thing).  And free / open source so that you can change it for specification.
Lacah	PT Serif	It is a nice bold and strong fond that represents the project goal. It also has a more modern feel which would be nice
Lacah	Lora	Doctors want to appear professional and in a professional setting they want to work with a professional font.  Patients are also more willing to trust a reliable looking font.
Lacah	Cantarell	The project name is complex, so a simple font is a nice compliment to the logo.
Lacah	Ubuntu	It's hard using a font designed for another brand, but Lacah really looks good in Ubuntu Bold.  Alternately, try Titillium Web Bold.
lecture connect	Open Sans	Casual, somewhat thicker font
lecture connect	Roboto Condensed	It looks simple and easy to use, but with a degree of seriousness
Lecture Connect	Ubuntu	This makes the project look easy for the professors to use but also technically inclined so the professors will know it is a good project they can trust. 
Lunch Break	Lobster	Looks good...  (looks something happy)
Lunch Break	Libre Baskerville	The name of this project sounds light hearted, but the actual problem statement is quite serious. It is important therefore to not use a font that looks too casual or silly, which is why I felt that a more classic, "trustworthy" look was better.
Lunch Break	Merriwheather	This font is serious, but also elegant.  
Lunch Break	Amatic SC	It's a very light, comforting font.
Lunch Break	Lora	This should be comforting and make the reader feel like they're in good hands. The font is serious.
MedConnect	Roboto Slab	Similar to font on webmd. clear and easy to read
MedConnect	Roboto Condensed	Social media-like service targeted at young users --> sans-serif font for a clean, modern feel
MedConnect	Russo One	Looks something rigid and reliable Value is high so makes thing feel solid
MedConnect	Ubuntu, with blue for 'Med' and Black for 'Connect'	You want a modern, sans-serif font to make it fit in with the world. And the 'n's in this look good aesthetically. 
MedConnect	Lato	It looks like a slightly professional sans-serif font. Since it's for younger med students looking for question, I think the sans-serif is more relaxed.
MedConnect	Georgia	Conveys a sense of trust and reliability, which is important for a question-answer application.
Mew IV	Bree Serif	This font is bold, but also the smooth curves in the 'e' sort of communicate a sense of informality which is what the groups is trying to do with connecting professors to students. 
Mew IV	Lato	Their project wants to make interactions between students and professors simpler, and this is a simple and clean font without embellishments. It is also reminiscent of a scholastic setting which fits the theme of their project.
Mew IV	Comic Sans MS	Education /is/ Comic Sans.
Mew IV	Montserrat	Clean and simple, mimicking the simplicity and ease (hopefully) of connecting students and professors
Mew IV	Ubuntu	The font should be professional yet inviting, and Ubuntu looks like it's very high-tech but friendly.
MITBabies	Indie Flower	It's not very serious, and somewhat playful, much like a baby can be. 
MITBabies	Arimo	Looked for something that was easy to read, conveyed a sense of trustworthiness (we don't want to use a goofy font when you're asking someone to trust you with their child).
MITBabies	Source Sans Pro	It's a sans serif font which is great for headings, and it looks like a solid reliable font, which is what people want in their babysitters.
MITBabies	Arimo	This google font looks very modern and is easy to read in urgency, in case users are filling jobs in their project at last minute.
News Bridge	Georgia	This project focuses on assisting elderly users browse the internet. As a result, I would use a font type that provides a moderately serious tone.
News Bridge	Oswald Normal	News Bridge sounds like a name you can trust and that font look legitimate and sincere.
News Bridge	Lora	To me, it seems like a slightly more modern but traditional font. It has serifs which resemble the newspapers which elderly would be more familiar with, but appears to be easy to read.
News Bridge	Open Sans	Nice bold font with no frills that should be clear for the elderly to read.
News Bridge	Slabo	It has strong value for each character and large kerning between characters, making the font particularly easy for the elder generation to read. It also resembles printed text from typewriters, which old people might be familiar with.
News Bridge	Roboto Slab	The font is clear and readable, which will appear to elders, and the serifs work well for a site about news, because it's like a newspaper.
NewsBridge	Oswald	This project deals with navigation for the elderly so a font that they would have seen in print in their early years would better resonate with them.
Plan-It Express	Bitter	Bitter is designed for reading large amounts of text on a screen, as opposed to making a title stand out.  The Code Doctors seems like it will rely upon people reading large amounts of other people's code, so this font choice will optimize for that.
Plan-It Express	Abel	This font is simplistic and distinct, so it has some amount of professionalism to it. It also is slim and narrow, which subliminally conveys the idea of speed that is relevant to their project
Plan-It Express	Yanone Kaffeesatz	Their project name makes reference to a company in the show Futurama, bringing in the idea of future and laid-back-ness. Thus, the font Yanone Kaffeesatz provides letters that are thin and tall, with slim strokes, giving the look of sleek and modern, along with sans serif, which gives the look of laid-back-ness.
Plan-It Express	Open Sans Condensed	It's sans serif which is appropriate for a quick-to-use, eye-catching app rather than a formal text. It is also condensed which gives a feeling of compactness and agility (especially with the word Express). Consider italicizing the word Express.
PortPholio	PT Serif	Because PortPholio is for displaying photos and connect photographer to clients, I guess PT Serif will give the interface a more artistic look.  
portpholio	Old Standard TT	Creative and interesting, but not TOO stupid looking.
PortPholio	amatic	shadows into light pathway gothic one amatic - really like the handwritten aspect. echos the customization of your site
PortPholio	Lobster	Our website is for photographers, and Lobster is a very fancy font that looks like it's in cursive, so it looks artistic.
Posh Dev	Lora	I felt a serif font would be appropriate, because the website is aimed towards businesses. Since there are a wide variety of different businesses, many of which have different standards for how "traditional" they want things to be, a serif seems like a good font to convey reliability.
Posh Dev	Arvo	The use of slab serif fonts communicates the older style we discussed in class used by companies like Gap which gives an air of retro style and belies the style-focused aspects of the group.
Posh Dev	Georgia	They have a very interactive web app so using a well-respected and easily readable font is important.
Posh Dev	Noto Serif	Serif gives sense of reliability, dependability, trustworthiness. A more modern serif font than others conveys innovation
Posh Dev	Cooper Demi	It's a good font for efficiency in reading since the app is a business utility.
Posh Dev	Crimson Text	I looked for something professional, clean, clear, but also modern and light.  http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Crimson+Text
Posh Dev 	Cabin	I chose this font because it is sans-serif and appropriate for body text. It is easy to read, and appears to be more of a modern font, which would reflect Posh Dev's desire to convey that they are a modern tool to help small businesses organize projects and billing clients. The font is also professional, which is important to a business-related site like Posh Dev.
RecrÃ¼t	Lora	The project is intended for helping recruiters in their process, therefore, I thought the font should be professional looking.
Recruit	Oswald	I chose this font because it was official and bold, which matches the Recrut's goal of handling job applications.
Recrut	Lato	Sans-serif because you don't seem to have to display a major amount of text - you're displaying mainly names, headers, etc.  Lato because it's a clean sans-serif font with a lot of different bold,italic,weight options
Recrut	Neue Helvetica	This san serif font's light strokes would nicely balance all the info they are aiming to showcase on their pages. 
Recrüt	Raleway	The clean and open style of Raleway matches well with their choice of a startup-y teamname (based on letters omitted & use of umlaut)
Recrüt	Open Sans Condensed	Adequate spacing and style make the letters seem taller, crisp and professional.
Recrüt	Pacifico 	The 'R' and the 'ü' have balance in this Pacifico font style. It is a decorative font that matches the decorative word formation that Recrüt uses.   A facebook-blue type color (or darker shades of such) would work well with this logo.
Recrüt	Pathway Gothic One	Down to business / professional. Yet still sleek and modern. Appropriate for an app that's managing job applications. 
RIP	Alfa Slab One	athletic feel, strong, solid
RIP	Avenir Next	Avenir is a geometric typeface, and it acts as a symbol of the future. As the wiki isn't loading, I'm guessing this is a social network for dead people. And a futuristic font is fitting, because it reminds us that in all of our futures is certain death.  
RIP	Raleway	I like this font for this project because it's a strong font, relating it well to anything involving sports. However, it's also modern and sort of trendy looking, so it would do well in today's internet.
RIP	Cinzel	the name is very short, so I went for a font that really grabs your attention. also since its RIP, want to make it kinda ominous.
Shoes	"Roboto Condensed"	This google font is very nice and readable. Readers get the feeling you can trust the text, not like comic sans
Shoes	Cabin	It seemed friendly somehow, charitable.
Shoes	Archivo Black	Modern and stands out
Shoes	Pacifico	A friendly but precise script logo goes with the informal name for a fairly formalized process (i.e. delivery).
Showcase	Lobster	Lobster...looks awesome. Also possibly Indie Light,bangers, or showered by grace
Showcase	Lobster	Lobster...looks awesome. Also possibly Indie Light,bangers, or showered by grace
SocTrade	Source Sans Pro	Relaxed and accessible, so that individual stock traders get a sense of being comfortable. Reminiscent of new and trendy web companies to convey the sense of being hip and social.
Spokes	Libre Baskerville	The letters are large and open which makes me think of bicycle wheels
Spokes	Arimo	Compact, easy to read font. Doesn't take up as much space as other fonts, which is ideal for an on-the-go situation.
Spokes	Righteous	spiky
Spokes	Arvo	This font is clean and modern-looking, which effectively encapsulates the spirit of this high-tech application for planning bike routes.
Spokes	Arapay	Out of time, sorry!
Spokes	Montserrat	Looks artistic (want to associate attractive fonts with attractive bike routes) without being difficult to read.
Struggle Bus	Lobster	It's artsy 
TableMaestro	Open Sans Condensed	Thin, clean, makes it seem easy-to-use, modern
TableMaestro	Playball	The cursive int his font is easy to read but fits the "maestro" theme well
TableMaestro	Kimberly Geswein	It looks like handwriting, like the quick style used by wait staff.
TableMaestro	Poiret One	It's classy, simple, and interesting -- fits the theme of TableMaestro
TableMaestro	Alegreya	It's an easy-to-read serif, but something about it (the slants and non-geometric angles) give it a classic look that seems like a good fit for a restaurant
TableMaestro	Lora	its a classy, simple font
TableMaestro 	open sans	this is just a good font to use and is clean and easy to read, which as a user i would want out of any app.
tacit	Electrolize	It looks very engineery and technologish
Tacit	Lobster	It looks cool
Tacit	Poiret One	It's a very clean, modern, "designed"-looking font that goes well with the modern trend of minimalism in design, so it's appropriate for a tool for designers.
Tacit	Droid Serif	Tacit sounds like a serious type of project
Tacit	Poiret One	This font is clean and easy to read. aditionally its light lines and big arcs on curves will parallel the design elements of the program.
Tacit	Merriweather	This is a very elegant font that is a serif but fits the furniture vibe
Tacit	Playfair Display	Font is readable, good kerning, generally pretty.
Tacit	Lato	Seems structurally sound
tacit	Stardos Stencil	designer/engineering look-like
Tacit	Comic sans	Something playful could be nice.
Tacit	Open Sans	It seemed like a more modern,sans-serif font was more applicable for an app of this type.
Tacit	Dancing Script	Looks cool...
Team Awesome 1	Lato	Didn't have a lot to go on from your name, so I just picked a pretty standard and nice font
Team Awesome 1	BenchNine 1	Loooked "awesome" 
Team Awesome 1	Oswald	The logo feels like it should be big and bold to match the feel of the project
Team Awesome 1	Hind	Project is actually called "Plan-it Express." Team Awesome 1 is team name.  Their project is about providing reliability, but also want to communicate that it's easy to use so I picked a font with a slightly thicker weight for reliability, and sans-serif for easy.
Team Awesome 1	Oxygen	The app seems like it's promoting a fast efficient feel and I wanted something that was simple.
Team Awesome 2	Lato	randomly because the page wouldn't load TT
Team Awesome 2	Lobster 2	It is scripted yet neat, so I felt it captured the spirit of both music (free spirited, artsy), and education / classroom setting. As the website is meant for teachers and students to keep track of their music portfolios, it seemed appropriate. 
Team Awesome 2	Old decorated fonts, "Baskerville"	Since this is directed towards teachers, a formal text could be used. With some musical keys to accentuate some characters. SO i think in this case a custom font would be nice.
Team Awesome 2	Raleway	The "w" in awesome looks super neat in this 
Team Awesome 2	Overlock	This application is built to help professors and students keep track of different pieces of music for both teaching and learning.  Each piece of music is represented by a short title, so the font needs to look good as a headline.  Overlock is nice because it has rounded glyph shapes, leading to a flowing look which is specifically best for titles and short text -- like song names, for instance.
Team Awesome 2	Architects daughter	Seemed musical.
Team Awesome 2	Droid Sans	It looks like an older font which would fit well with the project's theme. The project deals with listening to classical music compositions, and so a more "archaic" looking font is appropriate
Team Awesome 2	Rock Salt	The UI should remove the barrier between students and professors so as to encourage collaboration -- a more fanciful handwritten font goes to that end.
Team Awesome 2	Domine	This font is bold so it stands out well for a logo, but there is also something whimsical about it, which reminds me of music. 
Team Awesome 2	Lobster	streamlined superhero-y font, seems pretty awesome (the wiki wasn't loading so I had to base my choice off of the team name)
Team Goat	Playfair Display	readable, modern, yet still a little fun for your fun team name
Team Goat	Roboto Slab	Looks professional but also modern--ties into the fact they are trying to teach English through articles but use technology as a guide
Team Goat	Lora	Serif, because their team deals with books and information. Gives a sense of being trustworthy, reliable
Team Goat	PT Sans	The project is about learning english from articles, so you want an easily readable font for people learning the language (and easily recognizable), so a sans-serif font seems to make sense.
Team Goat	PT Sans	Relaxed. maybe a serif would be better.
TeamBuildr	Francois One	The font seemed bold, which fit into the theme of this project.
TeamBuildr	Source Sans Pro	The font is a sans-serif with simple/clean appearance. The project is going to be used by people who need to sort tasks and clearly have things delineated - a clean font would complement that.
TeamBuildr	Source Sans Pro	It's a serif font that is not too decorative, and relatively serious-looking, as befitting the business-esque audience and tasks.
TeamBuildr	Montserrat	I looked for a sans-serif font that would reflect the playfulness of the name (no 'e' in builder) and also reflect the sports theme of the project. Thinking about sports, I wanted a sturdier font that is weighty. 
TeamBuildr	Bevan	At first I was going to go for Tumblr's font (given the name similarity), but then opted for something for sports-related. I opted for a thicker, more serious looking font, and ended up choosing Bevan. 
TeamBuildr	Droid Serif 	This project is geared towards the college application market. The serif font conveys a sense of stature and credibility that would benefit this type of application well. 
TeamBuildr	Muli	The font is modern and stylish which complements the entertainment-oriented scope of the project
TeamBuildr	Paytone One	Not too serious, also makes the R stand out. 
TeamBuildr	Slabo	It looks modern but also official and looks very clean (The wiki page wouldn't load on my computer so I couldn't really get a feel for the project, but I'm just judging by the name)
TeamBuildr	Anton	It's bold, as a sports team should be
TeamBuildr	Oswald	It is a great font without serifs that is sleek with equal character with a a high value and medium boldface.
TeamBuildr	Droid Sans	I wanted to pick a font resonanting with the sports culture which is what TeamBuildr is about.
TeamBuildr	Lobster	it has a playful feel to it; and I can see it fitting with their interface well.
TeamBuildr	Titillium Web	The font is angular and gives a strong kind of feeling, which might be something that the project is going for.
TeamBuildr	Special Elite	Gritty aspect has association with sports. 
TeamBuildr	Lora	Stock trading platforms generally are used by people who are very work-oriented and favor traditional/dry appearance. A serif font suits this best
TeamBuildr	Graduate	It looks very "letterman jacket"-y. Only font i saw that conveyed any type of sportiness.
TeamBuildr	Archivo Narrow	i dont know
TeamBuildr	Open Sans	The font is easy to read
The Blobs	Francois One	It's more of an artsy project, so I thought this font name fit well. 
The Blobs	Chewy	Looked thick and blobby and fun/artsy (matching singing)
The Blobs	Titan One	It is very big and blobby so it fits with the name blobs 
The Blobs	Architects Daughter	"The Blobs" makes me thing of something very informal
The Blobs	Luckiest Guy	It has a nice heavy weight, which makes it Blob-like so it fits the title. It also seems somewhat playful and friendly, which seems like good qualities for something that listens to you sing.
The Blobs	Poiret One	It is playful and looks musical.  The name of this project is playful and the project relates to music.
The Blobs	Lobster	Stylish, like pop singers. Smooth, like a singer's voice. Showy, like singing TV shows like The Voice or American Idol. But isn't an eyesore, and fits well with other tech fonts (e.g. Foodler)
The Blobs	Playfair Display	Because your project deals with the fine arts, your logo should convey class and sophistication. A serif font is therefore desirable.
The Code Doctors	Vollkorn	This is an academic project and I think it needs a serious, weighty font to convey that it's Serious Business. Also, its essence demands a serif font.
The Code Doctors	Dhurjati	Edgy, readable but with a modern twist to it. It's reminiscent of a terminal-like font or an action movie. 
The Code Doctors	Lato	Lato has a high value about it that communicates a message of formality 
The Code Doctors	Slabo 27px	It is somewhat more formal, as the project description suggests that the target group will be professors.  However, it still has the simplicity that we are looking for.
The Code Doctors	Lobster	It's classic, with an almost vintage feel, which jives with the word 'Doctors' and conveys a sense of respect/authority
The Code Doctors	Oswald	The Code Doctors is innovative so I picked a san-serif font. 
The Code Doctors	Lora	The  project is aimed at the scientific community, so using this font gives a classic feel that is related to how scientific literature (think latex)
The Code Doctors	Caudex	This font looks nice and formal, but is not too classic-looking, and not too casual-looking (since the project is with wet labs).
The Loung	Covered By Your Grace	The project is about street performers, which would indicate a more relaxed and unconventional font.
The Lounge	Poiret One	They used Lobster in their prototypes but I think a more refined font like Poiret One can add some legitimacy to street performer art.
The Lounge	Pacifico	Want something that is playful since it is a social network
The Struggle Bus	Merryweather	The space between the S and the t and between the r and the u need to be big enough in order for it to be readable (i.e. we want no kerning). These font looks very nice also.
The Struggle Bus	Merriweather	It's a serif font that improves readability and has good kernings. I may also have some subjective preference to it (I like how it looks)
The Struggle Bus	Lobster	Once again this is a project with artistic undertones (photography), and lobster maintains that tone while remaining legible and readable.
The Van Helsing's	Lora	With all the serifs it looks formal, suitable in an educational situation and resembling the fonts used on textbooks. It's also very easy to read.
The Van Helsing's	PT Sans Narrow	The project is designed for teachers and students, so using a narrow font like PT Sans Narrow seemed to fit the academic nature of this project well.
The Van Helsing's	Coming Soon	It looks like if a teach had written Tally on the board to take a count of student responses.
The Van Helsing's	Oswald	The Wiki won't open for me, so I'm inferring from the name that we are looking for something intense-feeling, with thick verticals. 
The Van Helsing's	Josefin Sans	can be kind of light and playful
The Van Helsing's	Dancing Script 	The font looks very fun and seems like it will go well with the classroom/student idea. 
The Van Helsing's	Signika	simple/easy to read, reminds me of the problem statement since it suggests that your app is an easy way to assess student performance
Trendsetters	Times (or something formal)	Chess is a pretty old and respectable game, so some sort of Times or decorated font like "The Times" uses would work well, i'd think.
Trendsetters	Oswald	I like the value it has; i think bolding the "setters" could be a powerful effect.
Trendsetters	Bree Serif	Looks kind of old-timey/classical, and chess is a very classic game.
Trendsettr	Lato	Chose randomly because page wouldn't load TT
Wei + babes	Lobster	It's very babe. 
Wei + babes	Arial	They are creating a mobile app to help Uber drivers. The mobile screen is narrow and the font should be easily readable and stand out well among surrounding components. Going with a respected sans serif font would be a good choice.
Wei + babes	Source Sans Pro	It's modern-looking, fitting the modern style of the Uber app
Wei + babes	Source Sans Pro	It's modern-looking, fitting the modern style of the Uber app
Wei + babes	Cinzel	It looks nice
Wei + babes	Shadows Into Light	The name is either silly or cute, depending on how you see it, so I chose a font that's on the approachable and non-serious side.
Wei + Babes	Amatic SC	I think this font is simple, yet gives a sense of seriousness (no frills) - a match for an application that has a wide target user base in terms of technological aptitude and wants to make the most money
Wei + babes	Pacifico	It seems like the font should be connected to flow since they have an Uber app.
Wei + babes	Shadows Into Light	You had a cute name, it seems like it should be displayed in a cute font (even if it's not the most readable).
Wei + babes	Alegreya Sans	Close to Sans Serif but more bold and weighted so can be prominent and more likely to be used
wei+babes	wallpoet	techy looking
Wei+babes	Lora	Serif - because the Uber logo uses serif 
YungUI	Pablo Impallari	The project deals with road stops and such, and this font looks kind of like a Diner logo.
YungUI	Bangers	I think this is a playful font that is still readable. The idea is based on road trips which are supposed to be fun, so font attempts to give off this feeling.
YungUI	Lato	Their project is a road-tripping app, so I tried to pick something that looked modern (so a sans-serif font) and readable from a distance
YungUI	Oswald	Their project is about organization and planning. This is a serious activity that involves the well-being of travelers who use the app. Oswald font displayed the name of the project with straight lines and even spaces, which alludes to organization - which represents the app accordingly. The even fonts displayed seriousness, which appeals to a user's willingness to use the app for his or her travel planning.
