## Announcements on the board

## HoFS

Today’s Hall of Fame and Shame is a comparison of two generations of Google Advanced Search.

(Aside: how do you even find Google Advanced Search?  It's not linked from the Google homepage at all!  It can be found by googling for it, or by clicking the gear icon on a search results page.  Learnability...)


Let’s compare and contrast these two interfaces in terms of:
- visibility (specifically self-disclosure)
- graphic design
- task analysis
- efficiency

Visibility
- When expanding the page horizontally, show how to do this in regular interface, learnability.

Graphic design
- less busy with more whitespace
- 2 column has more simplicity, more alignment
- equal width columns are simpler
- grouping all search-related items
- contrast is better

Task analysis
- Important tasks up top 

Efficiency
