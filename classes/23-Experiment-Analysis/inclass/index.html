## HoFS

Today’s Hall of Fame or Shame example is a feature of Microsoft Office 2007 that gives a preview of what a style command will do to the document while you’re mousing over it.  Here, the mouse is hovering over the 54-point choice on the font-size drop-down, and PowerPoint is showing what the selection would look like with that new style.

Let’s discuss the pros and cons of this approach from a usability point of view.



## Nanoquiz


## Looking at the data

Walk through the class with their first few R commands:

```
dataset = read.csv(file.choose())

dataset

summary(dataset)

attach(dataset)

condition

time

dataset[1,1]

dataset[1,]

dataset[condition=="dictionary",]

summary(dataset[condition=="dictionary",])

summary(dataset[condition=="gibberish",])
```

## Graphing the data

Bar plot of the means

```
gibberishTimes = dataset[condition=="gibberish",]$time
dictionaryTimes = dataset[condition=="dictionary",]$time

means = c(mean(gibberishTimes), mean(dictionaryTimes))

mp = barplot(means)

?barplot

mp = barplot(means, xlab="Condition", ylab="Time", names.arg=c("gibberish", "dictionary"), ylim=c(0,8000))
```

Now add standard error:

```
se = c(sd(gibberishTimes)/sqrt(length(gibberishTimes)), sd(dictionaryTimes)/sqrt(length(dictionaryTimes)))

segments(mp, means-se, mp, means+se)

segments(mp-0.1, means-se, mp+0.1, means-se)
segments(mp-0.1, means+se, mp+0.1, means+se)
```

## T test

What are the possible t tests?

+ paired (what experiment design is this appropriate for?)
+ unpaired with equal variance assumption
+ unpaired with unequal variance

Run the unpaired t test

```
?t.test

t.test(gibberishTimes, dictionaryTimes)

t.test(gibberishTimes, dictionaryTimes, paired=TRUE)
```

Write on the board how this would be reported in a paper


## ANOVA

```
aov = aov(dataset$time ~ dataset$condition, dataset)

summary(aov)
```
