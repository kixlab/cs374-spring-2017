Supple: Automatic Generation of Personalizable User Interfaces

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B63whNtp4qc


- alternatively: from Krzysztof's Harvard talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEh8S7A4Cuc
	- 7:00 - 9:30 (user context), 16:54 - 19:30 (interface demo)

- in the middle, mention cost(interface) = time
	- how quickly the user can perform a selection task
- also mention the calibration phase of asking users to perform simple tasks (pointing, selection, etc.)
- explore the large design space of possible interfaces and pick an "optimal" one

# Part 2


## KLM Modeling


# Diff with Reading
- removed chunking: move to human abilities

# Post Class Notes
- GOMS, KLM, and Fitts' Law probably should be covered in a single class
