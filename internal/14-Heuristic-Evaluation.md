Canceled, because today's class is all about this.
This class basically will give you a better way to participate in UI HOFS discussion, by referring to common langauge and guidelines.

# Heuristic Evaluation
multiple ways to evaluate
- empirical: assess with real users
- formal: models and formulas to calculate measures
- automated: software measures
- critique: expertise and heuristic feedback

don't waste users on the small stuff
- heuristic evaluation for minor issues cheaply, efficiently

indedendent + group later

can be done on various types of prototypes

## Examples

freedom: close dates in flight schedule

flexibility: keyboard shortcuts, defaults + options, Gmail: "you might want to" not just literal actions (filter simliar messages)

removing flexibility: no delete keyboard shortcut in evernote

recognition over recall: avoid codes (KAIST academic system phone interface), previews are super powerful (Mac Finder sidebar, print dialog)

show status: breadcrumbs, response time examples, stages, quota display (show % in-class activity), your document has been changed (small icon that changes in Sublime Text)

Prevent errors: GitHub delete repo, "Don't save" and "Cancel" can be confusing, KAIST CS room reservation interface

Make the problem clear: type mismatch, Bosss_day

Support error recovery
- Show path forward: Chrome 404, network error dialog (list of things you might want to try out)
- provide alternatives: auto-correct, google search
- recognize errors: reported attack site

provide help
- with examples
- end-user license agreement experience is horrible
- creative commons: easy to follow guides and short summaries and human-readable versions
- fun 404 pages

# Video Break

- think how to do heuristic evaluation for technology like this

# Activity
12 mins is good enough. ~200 from ~70 students.

# Post Class Notes
First part felt a bit boring, since I kept on saying everythihng. How to make this more interactive and interesting?

More video / animation to highlight the heuristic (or violation) in action? 

Activity can be refined?
