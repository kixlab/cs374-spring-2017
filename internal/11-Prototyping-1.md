Walk around and give suggestions
- ask students "what task are you prototyping?"
- many groups try to build the whole thing. make sure to encourage them to focus on the "core experience."

# Post Class Notes
- how would you paper prototype xxx worked quite well
- spent too much time in the earlier part of the course
	- probably too many videos
- show tools: from the physical toolbox, show what's available and encourage students to use them.
- d.tools: students don't seem to "get" it that much.
