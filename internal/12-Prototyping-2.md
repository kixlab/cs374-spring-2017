## Kramer's Moviefone video

From the episode, “The Pool Guy”. Kramer gets his phone number changed because of “…chicks man. Too many chicks know my number.” His number is changed to 555-3455, but this drives him even more crazy because he keeps getting wrong number calls every five minutes. Jerry deduces that 555-3455 is 555-FILK, which by itself is nothing, but 555-FILM is Moviefone, and is just one digit off from Kramer’s number. People are calling to get Moviefone and are dialing Kramer’s number by mistake. At first this annoys him, but then he decides he kind of likes “helping out” Moviefone by looking up movie showtimes for the people that are calling him. George ends up calling Moviefone and getting Kramer by mistake. Kramer instructs George in his best Moviefone voice, “Using your touch-tone keypad, please enter the first three letters of the movie title, now.” George enters C-H-U for “Chunnel”, the movie he’s looking for. But of course Kramer has no idea what he pressed since he’s just on his regular home phone; he just hears the buttons being pressed. So, Kramer just guesses that George has selected “Agent Zero”, and tells him to press 1 if that is correct. When the button isn’t pushed, Kramer guesses another movie. When he’s wrong again, he just says, “Why don’t you just tell me the name of the movie you’ve selected?”


# Video Prototyping 
(1:23, 5 mins)

- quick to make (if storyboard and paper prototype are there)
- illustrate context of use
- full usage scenario needs to be thought out
- good storyboards can yield quick videos
- not interactive
- can be caught up in detail

- play the parts that set up the context / describe the scenario
- play the parts with interaction mockup

# In-class Paper Prototyping
Walk around and give suggestions
- ask students "what task are you prototyping?"
- many groups try to build the whole thing. make sure to encourage them to focus on the "core experience."


# Diff with Reading


# Post Class Notes
- In-class building + testing worked fine.
- Good way to give students feedback on their design direction.
- Some students are done too quickly, have trivial tasks designed, etc. Make sure to guide them.
