Why?

Today's reading is the first in a series about graphic design for graphical user interfaces, and I want to explain why we're doing this.

We've made a point (earlier) that this course is focused on usability, but many of the guidelines in the upcoming readings are more about aesthetics than pure usability. Serious *mistakes* in graphic design certainly affect usability, however, so we're trying to help you avoid those pitfalls. There's also a phenomenon, sometimes called the Aesthetic Effect, that attractive user interfaces (like attractive people) are *perceived* as more usable, whether they are or not.

But there's a larger question here: in practice, should software engineers have to learn this stuff at all? Shouldn't you just hire a graphic designer and let them do it? Some people think that the most important lesson a software engineer can learn from a course like 6.813 is "UI design is *hard*; leave it to the *experts*." The person who told me that was a high-level designer at Microsoft Research. I was tempted to retort that *designers* shouldn't bother learning to *program* either, but I don't actually believe that so I held my tongue.

But there's some substance to the argument: a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing, and that a programmer with a little experience in UI design but too much self-confidence can be just as dangerous as an artist who's learned a little bit of HTML and thinks they now know how to program. But I prefer to believe that a little knowledge is a step on the road to greater knowledge. Some of you may decide to *become* UI designers, and this course is a step along that road.

In a commercial environment, you *should* hire experienced graphic designers, just as you should hire an architect for building your corporation's headquarters and you should contract with a licensed building firm. Big jobs for big bucks require experts who have focused their education and job experience on those problem. One reason this course is useful is that you can appreciate what UI experts do and evaluate their work, which will help you work on a team with them (or supervise them).

But it's also worth learning these principles because you can apply them yourself on smaller-scale problems. Are you going to hire a graphic designer for every PowerPoint presentation you make, every chart you draw, every web page you create, every blog post you write? Those are all user interfaces. Many interactions and communications in life have a user interface, and many of them are up to you to do-it-yourself. So you should know when to leave it to the experts, but you should be able to do a creditable job yourself too, when the job is yours to do. 

# Simplicity

# Contrast

Strive for simplicity

- Reduce features and data displayed
- Regularize visual properties that aren’t important
- Make elements perform double-duty

Enhance contrast

- Choose visual variables carefully
- Use the squint test
