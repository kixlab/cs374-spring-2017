# UI HOFS
Google Drive


Google Drive is an online storage, where you can store documents, photos, etc.It takes a desktop file manager metaphor for web documents and folders that are synchronized across all shared users. A design challenge is in combining the familiar desktop file management language with the online sharing language.

Consider the web interface for Google Drive. Analyze its usability with respect to:

- Graphical layout: the squint test, visual variables, spacing, etc.
    - accent color: red, blue
    - two-column layout
    - simplistic design
    - generous use of space between items
- Adherence to user interface conventions
    - consistency across different Google apps
    - desktop metaphor
- Simplicity (what functionality is offered, how simply is it expressed?)
- Learnability and efficiency; information scent
    - "Shared with Me", "Starred", "Recent"


### Main panel
- Icons: shared folders, document types, users
- Color: monochromatic, shade of gray for less important (last modifier)
- Breadcrumb: visual cue about where the user is, good information scent
- Typographical emphasis: bold for selected sorting criterion


### Sidebar (Old sidebar vs New sidebar)

- Icons: part of typography
    - Easier to notice, consistent visual language
- Simplified "NEW" button
    - Having both "Create" and "Upload" is confusing. The mental model or the overall goal of the user is to "Add" something in both cases.
- Spacing
    - More visual space, probably larger target area. Good because there's enough space.
- Color
    - Gray background in the sidebar visually separates it from the main panel
- Font
    - "Roboto" vs default Sans-serif

# Meta Point
pattern in how we approach different design-related topics in this class (layout, color, typography, etc.)

- low-level understanding: how the human cognitive process works (perceptual capabilities + machine funcationality)
- high-level UI design considerations (identity, aesthetics, emotion)

The most important guidelines will be applications of rules we already discussed in graphic design: simplicity as much as possible, contrast where important.

# Color

## Factors that matter
10 mins

Do it on the board: "Why does color matter?"

- color blindness
- emphasis
- gender
- culture
- affect
- metaphor
- aesthetics

Color as identity of a service / brand - consistently using the main color in various parts of the interface 

- Facebook: blue 
- Twitter: skyblue
- YouTube: red
- Naver: green

Mac OS’s window control 

- traffic light metaphor: but does that match with the actions? 
- double duty: tell you what it does, color associated

## Brand Identitiy: iMac

As part of his comeback strategy for Apple, Jobs unveiled the unique, transparent, curvy and colorful "Bondi Blue" design of the first iMac G3. Advertisements for the all-in-one computer portrayed it as "Chic. Not geek.”"The whole thing is translucent, you can see into it — it's so cool," Jobs said onstage, as all sides of the iMac were being shown to the audience via a wireless camera. "The back of this thing looks better than the front of the other guys'," he went on to say.Apple also pushed the fresh look of the new iMac in a series of commercials featuring the voice of actor Jeff Goldblum. In one television spot, Goldblum noted that the iMac was "more colorful" than the competition currently on the market. Of course, the key to Apple's strategy with the first iMac "G3" was not just its color. The desktop was also somewhat controversial at the time for omitting a 3.5-inch floppy disk drive — a legacy feature that virtually all computers at the time included.But colors became even more important to the G3 iMac in January of 1999, when the "Bondi Blue" shade was replaced with blueberry, strawberry, tangerine, grape and lime. In all, the iMac G3 was eventually released in a total of 13 different "flavors," which also included graphite, ruby, sage, snow, indigo, and the psychadelic "Flower Power" and "Blue Dalmatian" configurations.Apple's iMac G3 was released in a total of 13 different "flavors," making it one of the most colorful products in the company's history.

## Factors that matter

brainstorm different factors with class

- identity: luxury brands vs tech companies
- readability
- aesthetics
- affect
- appropriateness
- safety

- Gap logo (2 mins): One of the most disastrous rebranding efforts in the past decade came in 2010, when the Gap tried to cast off its bold 1969 logo for something in a generic sans-serif font with a blue square. The idea was for the Gap to look younger, fresher, and more “social media,” but it was roundly criticized online. The company went back to the old familiar logo after just a week.

- Save money (1 mins): Saving ink


## Readability
define fixations, saccades, comprehension (mention subvocalization: reading to yourself)

- brainstorm ways to handle whitespacing
- kerning, tracking, line height, leading

## Speed Reading
http://squirt.io/

why does this work / not work?

- discuss saccade, fixation, subvocalization
- shorten time for saccades
- comprehension may be hard (no easy access to missed words)

Skimming: Skimming is to glance through text to find important parts to read. Although this is usually considered a speed reading method, you’re not teaching yourself to read faster. You’re just learning which parts you can skip over. As you’d expect, studies show that we don’t remember that many details when we skim.

Meta guiding is one of the older techniques. It’s when you use a finger (or a pointer like a pen) to guide your eyes to specific words. The point is to decrease distraction and focus on the specific words to increase your reading speed.

RSVP: Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) is a method used by most of the recent digital speed reading systems. Single words flash on the screen so you’re concentrating on a single word at a time. As you get used to the system, you speed up how fast the display shows you words.

## Activity: Improve Readability

5-6 mins

- ask for size and weight suggestions first
- play with width and line-height showing good and bad
- ask for font faces

## Font
### Is comic sans actually bad?
- appropriateness
- overuse could be a problem

### Clearview (5 mins)
- Highway font: Gothic to Clearview
- Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l46fb_hn6yE
- Watch from the beginning to 2:15
- What are the design factors that designers took into account?

	- problem they’re solving: night driving, older drivers
	- potential alternative solution is to increase the size: The government’s highway engineers proposed increasing the size of the letters by 20 percent. But larger letters would mean even larger signs, a costly and cumbersome venture that would do little but increase visual clutter on the roadway. “You’re talking about billions of dollars,” Meeker said, explaining that on signs what is taller is also wider. “It wouldn’t just be a question of replacing the signs and all their support structures, but you would have to widen lanes and redo overpasses to make room for these things.”
	- study to demonstrate improvements is crucial: In nighttime tests, Clearview showed a 16 percent improvement in recognition over Highway Gothic, meaning drivers traveling at 60 miles per hour would have an extra one to two seconds to make a decision.
	- legible from far away: open spaces.

Clearview is a sans-serif face, meaning the terminal points of its letters lack any ornamental lines, wedges and other shapes. It wasn’t until the 1920s that sans-serif came into wide use with typefaces like Futura and later, in the ’50s, Helvetica, but they are now the typeface style of choice for any design job requiring a clean, vaguely futuristic aesthetic. The clear, pristine shapes of sans-serif fonts grab the eye in an instant, lending themselves to advertising copy and large, punchy headlines as well as highway signs. But in large blocks of text, the detailed edges of the letter forms in serif fonts give the type an easy-to-follow flow reminiscent of cursive script, making them the preferred typeface for newspapers, magazines and books.

# Post Class Notes
Activities worked out fairly well.

Some students were not sure how to modify CSS using Inspector. Show some examples.

Skipped Clearview example, as it was controversial.

Ink saving example doesn't seem to provide that insightful information.

Nanoquiz: 3(c): leading changes the value of text -- have we talked about "value" of text in class? The reading says value is brightness of text.
