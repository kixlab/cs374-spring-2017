## Locus of attention

Locus of attention is important, because as a UI designer, we can leverage this to direct people's attention in a meaningful way. If there's important information you want to display, it'd be useful to make sure they are in the locus of attention. Status bar is a bad example indeed.



## EXAMPLE: iPhone selection zoom

- because the finger obscures feedback, it shows a zoomed in view of the current text being selected.
- dual purpose: provide visual feedback and help with precise selection
- fat finger problem: fingers occlude information and prevent precise actions when using touch devices.
     - clearly user's goal is not met due to design issues.
     - what are some ways you can fix that?

Attention is tricky in that it handles only one channel at a time,
but yet it's so easy to shift that channel when external stimuli are available.
