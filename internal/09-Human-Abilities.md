# 09-Human Abilities

# Recap
- Taking a break from the design process classes, to give you time to work on DP2. Encourage going back in the cycle even all the way to needfinding if needed.

- This week we'll talk about human cognition, and start a series of implementation classes.

# MHP / Distributed Cognition

## Math: Motivation for Representation
Engaging start, worked quite well.

Intermediate "variable" tracking was mentioned as a reason for the slowed performance in the memory group.

## Tetris: Epistemic Action
Asked students to guess experts vs novices, which would exhibit more epistemic actions. Many got the answer wrong.

But the explanation was a bit too long. Make it concise and to the point.

Tetris: people move blocks more than they need to. Experts rely more heavily on moving objects in the world. Cheaper to do it in the world than to mentally rotate them.


Getting things done & Brainstorming
=> write it down, empty your working memory, move on


# Video Break
inFORM

- Ask students how distributed cognition was applied to physical objects, helping remote collaboration and externalization of ideas.

# Power of Representation

Representation dramatically affects our problem solving ability.


## Oranges and Bagels

Had volunteers and come out and solve.

Two reasons the bagels version is easier.

- The physical property of "stacking" bagels makes the rule easier to understand and apply. Reasoning task => transferred to a perceptual task of visually verifying.
- Also, it resembles the tower of Hanoi game, which many of us are familiar with.

## Card Game and Tic-Tac-Toe

Had volunteers play different versions.

Tic-Tac-Toe takes significantly shorter time, and ta-da, these games are actually isomorphic!

Herb Simon
- math proof: true also at the beginning. What has changed is the fact that the proof is true is rendered clear to the reader.

Why is it hard?
Embed the constraints of the problem in the UI: offload working memory, so that limited resources become available.

Naturalness principle
- experiential cognition is aided when the properties of the prepresentation match the properties of the thing that's represented.


## Subway Map Examples

London underground map
- what physical property is preserved?
- what task does it support well? what task does it fail to support well?
- context + overview (suberbs are sparse)
- "As a schematic diagram, it does not show the geographic locations but rather the relative positions of the stations, lines, the stations' connective relations, and fare zones."

slow reasoning task => fast perceptual task



	
## Case Study: active reading 
- what are the common tasks in reading?
- what are some of the cognitively challenging tasks a reader experiences?
	- highlighting, keeping track of various interesting parts, going back and forth between the body and ref, etc.

- Not sure if I want to keep this. Fun app, but not sure the take-home message is clear enough.


# Chunking
Need better explanation on the activity: what does the command do, and what is the partition % for?

# Diff with Reading


# Post Class Notes
Add GOMS?

Time-wise the full 75 mins were spent, even without the UI HOFS.

- the oranges game took much longer than I expected, but with the easier game version it should be faster next time.

- Distributed congnition: look at Chapter 3 of "Interaction Design"

- Zhang & Norman reading: add some of the content into the reading and video eventually.

## Distributed Cognition Notes from Scott
when interfaces help people distribute congnition, it can
- encourage experimentation (Tetris)
- scaffold learning and reduce errors (Montessouri blocks)
- Show differences that matter (London Underground)
- Convert slow calculation into fast perception (Map coloring)
- Support chunking, especially by experts (Chess & gestures)
	- moving text from A to B: copy A, move to B, paste A
- increase efficiency (diagrams)
- facilitate collaboration (cockpits)
	- artifacts help pilots coordinate action
	- speed dial

## Locus of attention

Locus of attention is important, because as a UI designer, we can leverage this to direct people's attention in a meaningful way. If there's important information you want to display, it'd be useful to make sure they are in the locus of attention. Status bar is a bad example indeed.



## EXAMPLE: iPhone selection zoom

- because the finger obscures feedback, it shows a zoomed in view of the current text being selected.
- dual purpose: provide visual feedback and help with precise selection
- fat finger problem: fingers occlude information and prevent precise actions when using touch devices.
     - clearly user's goal is not met due to design issues.
     - what are some ways you can fix that?

Attention is tricky in that it handles only one channel at a time,
but yet it's so easy to shift that channel when external stimuli are available.
