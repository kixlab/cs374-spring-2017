- gong sound helped quite a bit

Students have to clear the board twice for each new phase. Ask them to take a photo of the board and clear.

Setup takes 20-30 mins at least. Make sure to arrive early and put up the poster boards (전지) on the wall.

Some groups had poster boards (하드보드지) in the middle.
